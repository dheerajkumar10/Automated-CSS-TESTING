Just add any html and css code in this project file and style css file and give your default values and test the application 
We are trying to automate the css testing process with the htlp pf javascript
here we give standard scenario for the tags and if we give wrong value in css for any tag the jquery will run and add differenct back ground colors for deviant behaviour
