        <p>The failure of a presentation on a website can have a negative impact on quality of the website, the services
            it provides, and branding the company is trying to achieve. Presentation failure can easily occur in modern
            web applications due to the complex and powerful nature of HTML, CSS. Most of the companies follow specific
            font and colours for their website. They maintain consistency in their design throughout the website. Any
            anomaly in website CSS with consistency will lead presentation failure.</p>

                check with every line on static pages to find the missing CSS and automating the process of CSS
                testing will be a useful tool to give a report on website CSS.
